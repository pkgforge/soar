## 🪄 Quickstart

> [!TIP]
> - Soar comes as a single-file, statically-linked executable with no dependencies that you can simply [download](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/releases/latest) & run.
> - The [install script](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/blob/main/install.sh) does this & more automatically for you.
 
```bash
❯ cURL
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkgforge/soar/main/install.sh" | sh

❯ wget
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkgforge/soar/main/install.sh" | sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> - Please read & verify what's inside the script before running it
> - The script is also available through https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/install.sh & https://soar.pkgforge.dev/install.sh
> - Additionally, if you want to customize your installation, please read the docs @ https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/installation.html
> - For, extra Guide & Information on infra backends & adding more repos: https://docs.pkgforge.dev
> - Next, Check [Configuration](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/configuration) & [Usage](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/package-management)

## 🌟 Key Features

> [!TIP]
> - The comparision page @ https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme goes into more detail.

| Feature | Description |
|:--:|:--|
| **Universal Package Format Support** | Soar can install and manage portable package formats including [static binaries](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/binaries/static), [self-extractable archives](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/packages/archive), and [AppImages](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/packages/appimage). |
| **System Integration** | Soar [automatically integrates](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/#desktop-integration) installed packages with your system to provide a native-like experience. |
| **Flexible Repository System** | While Soar comes preconfigured with [official repositories](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories), you can [configure custom repositories](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/configuration#custom-repository-support) that use any build format as long as they provide compatible metadata. The `.SBUILD` format is only required for the official repositories, not for custom ones. |
| **Security First** | Soar enforces security through checksums and signing verification for package installations. |
| **Userspace** | Soar works completely in Userspace without Superuser (admin/sudo) Privileges. |
| **External Repository Support** | Soar can access packages from sources like [ivan-hc/AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) and [appimage.github.io](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io) through metadata provided by pkgforge. These external sources don't directly work with soar but are made compatible through pkgforge's metadata conversion. **Note:** Packages from external repositories are not verified. |
| **Fast Package Operations** | Soar provides efficient package searching, installation, and management with minimal overhead. |

## 📦 Packages

> [!TIP]
> Check out the detailed documentation @ https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs

| Feature | Description |
|:--:|:--|
| **Portable Packages** | Packages are designed to be [portable](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/) across distributions, either through [static linking](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/binaries/static) or by bundling all dependencies. This makes them [distro-agnostic](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/packages#portability). |
| **Extensive Collection** | Official repositories host one of the [largest collections](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/packages#total) of portable packages. Browse them with `soar list` or at [pkgs.pkgforge.dev](https://pkgs.pkgforge.dev/). |
| **Prebuilt Binaries** | 100% of official packages are provided as [prebuilts](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/faq#cache), making installation limited only by download speed. |
| **Quality Compilation** | Around 80% of packages are compiled from source with optimizations for performance (LTO), security (ASLR/PIE), and size (MUSL). |
| **High Security Standards** | Official packages are built with [SLSA Build L2 Security Guarantees](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/security). |
| **Community Contributions** | The [`.SBUILD`](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/sbuild/introduction) format in [pkgforge/soarpkgs](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) allows community members to submit package definitions, similar to AUR. |
| **Cross-Distro Compatibility** | Some packages are repackaged from other distro repositories, allowing you to run applications from e.g., Arch repositories on Debian-based systems without containers. |
| **Decentralized** | The portable nature of packages means they can be downloaded and used independently of Soar if needed. |

## ☢️ Caveats

> [!NOTE]
> - If you have additional questions, check our [FAQ](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/faq) or [create a discussion](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/discussions).

| Design Decisions | The Rationale |
|:--:|:--|
| **Not Reinvent things** | Soar isn't a package manager in the traditional sense, neither is it a [new standard](https://xkcd.com/927/). Think of soar as an amalgamation & the natural progression of tools like [AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM), [bin](https://github.com/marcosnils/bin), [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget), [hysp](https://github.com/pwnwriter/hysp), [nami](https://github.com/txthinking/nami) & [zap](https://github.com/srevinsaju/zap). |
| **Not a System Package Manager** | Soar intentionally complements rather than replaces your distro's package manager. Unlike [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew), we don't handle core system tools/libraries — we let distro package managers excel at that job. Soar provides additional packages or newer versions while avoiding conflicts by operating entirely in userspace and following XDG specifications. |
| **Not a Devtool Package Manager** | Soar doesn't handle development toolchains by design. We do have completely static/relocatable toolchains in our repo, but it will always be better to just use dedicated tools like [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf), [aqua](https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua), [chsrc](https://github.com/RubyMetric/chsrc), [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise), [vfox](https://github.com/version-fox/vfox) etc. |
