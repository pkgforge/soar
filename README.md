# Soar Package Manager

## üåü Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|:--:|:--|
| **Universal Package Format Support** | Soar can install and manage portable package formats including [static binaries](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/binaries/static), [self-extractable archives](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/packages/archive), and [AppImages](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/packages/appimage). |
| **System Integration** | Soar [automatically integrates](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/#desktop-integration) installed packages with your system to provide a native-like experience. |
| **Flexible Repository System** | While Soar comes preconfigured with [official repositories](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories), you can [configure custom repositories](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/configuration#custom-repository-support) that use any build format as long as they provide compatible metadata. The `.SBUILD` format is only required for the official repositories, not for custom ones. |
| **Security First** | Soar enforces security through checksums and signing verification for package installations. |
| **External Repository Support** | Soar can access packages from sources like [ivan-hc/AM](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM) and [appimage.github.io](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io) through metadata provided by pkgforge. These external sources don't directly work with soar but are made compatible through pkgforge's metadata conversion. **Note:** Packages from external repositories are not verified. |
| **Fast Package Operations** | Soar provides efficient package searching, installation, and management with minimal overhead. |

## üì¶ Packages Available Through Official Repositories

Packages in the official Soar repositories have these characteristics:

| Feature | Description |
|:--:|:--|
| **Portable Packages** | Packages are designed to be [portable](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/) across distributions, either through [static linking](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/formats/binaries/static) or by bundling all dependencies. This makes them [distro-agnostic](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/packages#portability). |
| **Extensive Collection** | Official repositories host one of the [largest collections](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/packages#total) of portable packages. Browse them with `soar list` or at [pkgs.pkgforge.dev](https://pkgs.pkgforge.dev/). |
| **Prebuilt Binaries** | 100% of official packages are provided as [prebuilts](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/faq#cache), making installation limited only by download speed. |
| **Quality Compilation** | Around 80% of packages are compiled from source with optimizations for performance (LTO), security (ASLR/PIE), and size (MUSL). |
| **High Security Standards** | Official packages are built with [SLSA Build L2 Security Guarantees](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/soar/readme/security). |
| **Community Contributions** | The [`.SBUILD`](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/sbuild/introduction) format in [pkgforge/soarpkgs](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) allows community members to submit package definitions, similar to AUR. |
| **Cross-Distro Compatibility** | Some packages are repackaged from other distro repositories, allowing you to run applications from e.g., Arch repositories on Debian-based systems without containers. |
| **Decentralized** | The portable nature of packages means they can be downloaded and used independently of Soar if needed. |

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Caveats
#### Soar doesn't reinvent things
Soar isn't a package manager in the traditional sense, neither is it a [new standard](https://xkcd.com/927/), thus soar doesn't handle core system tools/libraries by design.
This means soar is not a replacement for your distro's official package manager.<br>
Instead, Soar complements existing package managers by providing your distro with additional packages or newer version of packages that your distro may not provide.<br>
Soar is meant to coexist with existing package managers by avoiding conflicts, being completely functional in userspace & using XDG Specifications.<br>
For more questions, check our [FAQ](https://docs.pkgforge.dev/repositories/soarpkgs/faq) or [create a discussion](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/discussions).
