## 📦 What is Soar?

Soar is a **package manager** - it doesn't build or host packages itself. Instead, it consumes package metadata from repositories and handles downloading, installing, and managing packages on your system.

**How it works:**
- **Repositories** (like [soarpkgs](https://github.com/pkgforge/soarpkgs) - the default) build and host packages, providing metadata in a standard format
- **Soar** fetches this metadata, lets you search/install packages, and manages your local installations
- **You** can use soarpkgs, add third-party repos, or even create your own

This separation means Soar works with any compatible repository - it's not tied to a specific package source.

## 🪄 Quickstart

> [!TIP]
> - Soar comes as a single-file, statically-linked executable with no dependencies that you can simply [download](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/releases/latest) & run.
> - The [install script](https://github.com/pkgforge/soar/blob/main/install.sh) does this & more automatically for you.

```bash
# cURL
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkgforge/soar/main/install.sh" | sh

# wget
wget -qO- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkgforge/soar/main/install.sh" | sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> - Please read & verify what's inside the script before running it
> - The script is also available through https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/install.sh
> - Additionally, if you want to customize your installation, please read the docs @ https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/installation.html
> - Next, check [Configuration](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/configuration) & [Usage](https://soar.qaidvoid.dev/package-management)
